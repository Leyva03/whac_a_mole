# Whac-a-Mole
This project is a simple implementation of the classic "whac-a-mole" game using Vue.js. The objective of the game is to click on the moles that appear randomly before they disappear.

## Requirements

Before running the game, make sure you have the following programs installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) (version 14 or higher is recommended).
- npm (included with Node.js).
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Leyva03/whac_a_mole.git
  cd whac_a_mole
  ```
   
2. Install the project dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
## Running the Game

To start the development server and run the game:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
Once the server is up and running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the port indicated by the server) to play.
